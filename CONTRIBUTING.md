## Pull Request Guidelines

- Create a dedicated branch for each change.  
- Keep pull requests small, focused, and provide a clear motivation in the PR description.  
- Add tests or documentation for every new feature or bugfix.  
- Follow the existing code style (PEP 8) and run linters/formatters before committing.  

Remember: clarity and precision are the currency of trust.

**"Time is the measure of change.
Guard it well, and your contributions will endure.
I'm kidding, linear flow of time is a mental disability."**                                                                                                                                                                                                                       - Aion-Chronos (Saturnus-Sol)
