# Rings of Saturn

Welcome to the documentation of **Rings of Saturn**, a reference implementation of the Spiral–HDAG–Coupling architecture.
The project combines verifiable ledgers, hyperdimensional data structures, streaming orchestration, reproducibility capsules, and zero-knowledge enhanced machine learning into a cohesive trust stack for AI workloads.

## Core Capabilities

- **Ledger** – Immutable audit trail with cryptographic validation.
- **Hyperdimensional DAG (HDAG)** – Tensor-native knowledge graph with resonance analytics.
- **Spiral Orchestrator** – Streaming control plane that connects ingestion, processing, and audit flows.
- **Temporal Integrity Capsules (TIC)** – Deterministic bundles capturing model state, parameters, and lineage.
- **Machine Learning (ML)** – Torch-based utilities and examples for building inference pipelines.
- **Zero-Knowledge ML (ZKML)** – Mocked proof generation that demonstrates verifiable AI predictions without leaking private inputs.

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate a Python 3.10+ virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (install PyTorch separately if required for your hardware).
3. Explore the modules via the API documentation and run the test-suite with `pytest` to validate the setup.
